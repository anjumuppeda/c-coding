#calculator     
thi is a simple calculator program     
       
       operators are used     
       addition (+)    
       subtraction(-)
       multiplication(*)
       division(/)
       modulus(%)
          
          calculator.c is a source code file    
               
               console     
               #include<stdio.h>
int main()
{
    int a,b;
    printf("enter the first number\n");
    scanf("%d",&a);
    printf("enter the second number\n");
    scanf("%d",&b);
    printf("%d+%d=%d\n",sum);
    printf("%d-%d=%d\n",diff);
    printf("%d*%d=%d\n",mul);
    printf("%d/%d=%d\n",div);
    printf("%d%d=%d\n"rem);
    return 0;
}      

      #include<stdio.h> is a include the standard input ,output header file    
      int main this is a main function,the program start executing   
      int a,b is a two integer variables to store the inputs  
      printf is a show in the screen  
      scanf is a reads two integer values from the stores in a,b   
      sum is added both integers and show result
      diff is subtracts both integers and show result      
      mul is multiplies both integers and show result  
      div is divides both integers and show result
      rem isremainder both integers and show result   
       return 0 is ends the program
